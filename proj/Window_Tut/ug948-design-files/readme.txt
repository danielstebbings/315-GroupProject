2. OVERVIEW

This readme describes how to use the files that come with UG948, the Vivado System Generator Tutorial.

In the tutorial, you will do the following:


  Lab 1: Understand how to create and validate a model using System Generator. 
	 Make use of workspace variables to easily parameterize your models.
	 Synthesize the model into FPGA hardware, and then create a more optimal hardware version of the design.  
	 Learn how fixed-point data types can be used to trade off accuracy against hardware area and performance.

  Lab 2: Learn Modeling Control System with M-Code, incorporating existing RTL designs, written in Verilog or VHDL,
         into your design and Import C/C++ source files into a System Generator model by leveraging the tool integration with HLS.

  Lab 3: Learn how to do Timing and Resource Analysis and how to overcome timing violations.

  Lab 4: Learn how to create an efficient design using multiple clock domains.

  Lab 5: Use AXI interfaces and Vivado IP integrator to easily include your model into a larger design.
  

3. SOFTWARE TOOLS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

* Xilinx Vivado 2020.2
* MATLAB R2019a,R2019b,R2020a or R2020b
